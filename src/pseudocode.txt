1. BEGIN Program

2. CONNECT to Gmail's email server with account credentials
    - Use email address and password or OAuth for authentication

3. RETRIEVE all emails from every mailbox (Inbox, Sent, etc.)
    FOR each mailbox IN Gmail account
        GET all emails
        FOR each email IN mailbox
            STORE email in a database file
                - Include details such as sender, receiver, subject, date, and body
        END FOR
    END FOR

4. TOKENIZE all email information in the database file
    FOR each email IN database file
        TOKENIZE email details (sender, receiver, subject, date, body)
            - Split text into individual tokens (words, phrases, symbols)
    END FOR

5. CHUNKING -- Group adjacent tokens into chunks based on predefined patterns (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases)
    FOR each email IN database file
        FOR each tokenized detail (e.g., subject, body) IN email
            GROUP tokens into chunks
                - Use patterns like noun phrases or verb phrases
        END FOR
    END FOR

6. VECTORIZATION -- Convert tokens and chunks into vectors
    FOR each email IN database file
        FOR each chunk AND token IN email
            CONVERT chunk/token into vector
                - Use techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or one-hot encoding
        END FOR
    END FOR

7. QUERYING the Vectorized Email Database for a "To-Do" List
    - DEFINE a query to identify tasks for "Scott McEvoy" or "me"
    - PROCESS emails to extract tasks, deadlines, and urgency sentiments
        FOR each email IN vectorized database
            IDENTIFY tasks directed at "Scott McEvoy" or "me"
            EXTRACT deadlines and urgency sentiment using NLP techniques
            STORE tasks with their deadlines and urgency levels
        END FOR
    - PRIORITIZE tasks based on deadlines, urgency sentiment, and other factors
        SORT tasks by deadline (sooner to later)
        ADJUST priority based on urgency sentiment and importance
    - CREATE a "To-Do" list based on prioritized tasks
    - DISPLAY or SEND the "To-Do" list to "Scott McEvoy" or designate for action
